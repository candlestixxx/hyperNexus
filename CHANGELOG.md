# Changelog

## [1.0.0-alpha.65] - 2026-06-10

### Changed
- **CI Modernization**:
  - Upgraded GitHub Actions workflow execution to Node.js 24 across all 17 workflow steps to resolve deprecation warnings and test failures related to Node 20 end-of-life.
  - Adjusted Node.js engine compatibility ranges to `>=20.0.0` within isolated extensions.

## [1.0.0-alpha.64] - 2026-05-25

### Added
- **L2 Vault Visualization**:
  - Wired `trpc.healer.vaultRecords.useQuery` to the Next.js frontend to visualize persistent heal history.
- **Mobile Style Audit**:
  - Addressed overlapping elements and fixed hidden layout bugs in the Sidebar and System Pulse cards for mobile viewports.
- **TypeScript Compile Security & Alignment**:
  - Fully resolved all TypeScript compilation errors across `packages/core` by introducing the missing `ProviderAuthTruth` definitions and aligning `ProviderAuthState` and `ProviderQuotaSnapshot` with the new environment-telemetry models.
  - Eliminated unused `@ts-expect-error` directives, achieving a 100% clean type check.
- **Verification of Merged Feature Branches**:
  - Conducted deep graph audits and verified that all local and remote branches (`jules-...`, `nexus-...`) have been successfully merged into `main` with absolutely zero progress or feature regressions.

## [1.0.0-alpha.63] - 2026-05-25

### Added
- **Native Healer & L2 Vault Bridging**:
  - Implemented Go-native endpoints for `heal` and `vault/count` in the sidecar server.
  - Re-wired the TypeScript `healerRouter` to delegate all health and history queries to the Go kernel.
  - Unified the "Immune System" dashboard metrics with the Go `HealerService` state.
- **Ground Truth Mapping**:
  - Established field mapping (snake_case to PascalCase) for native records to ensure seamless UI integration without modifying the Go kernel's idiomatic output.

### Changed
- Updated all monorepo packages to version `1.0.0-alpha.63`.
- Improved accuracy of the Healer Vault counters by implementing total count queries in the SQLite backend.

## [1.0.0-alpha.62] - 2026-05-19

### Added
- **Deep Link Protocol Scheme (`hypernexus://`) in Go**:
  - Built robust URI handling for `hypernexus://attach?session=ID` and `hypernexus://create?cliType=aider` commands.
  - Implemented single-instance CLI dispatcher. Clicking deep links routes actions through the active `hypernexusd` daemon via HTTP REST.
- **SQLite L2 Vector Vault Visualizer**:
  - Implemented persistent database queries (`GetAllVaultRecords`) in Go fetching chronic vault memories ordered by importance and heat.
  - Wired the new tRPC `vaultRecords` query to the Next.js control plane to hook persistent SQLite vector records into the UI.
  - Re-designed the Healer dashboard in glassmorphic dark-mode, showing streaming active pathogens side-by-side with real persistent L2 Vault records.
- **Next.js Dashboard Routes**:
  - Added premium, highly interactive dashboard console cards for Blocks, Claude Chrome, Claude Cloud, Copilot, and OpenAI Codex.
- **LLM Instruction Unification**:
  - Resolved merge conflict markers and aligned role guidelines across `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `GPT.md`, and `copilot-instructions.md` under `docs/UNIVERSAL_LLM_INSTRUCTIONS.md`.

### Changed
- Standardized documentation identity to HyperNexus Kernel & HyperCode.
- Replaced git merge conflict markers across multiple internal Kotlin and Markdown files with unified content logic.

## [1.0.0-alpha.61] - 2026-05-17

### Added
- **Autonomous Healer Loop (The Immune System)**:
  - New `HealerService` in the Go kernel with a multi-turn `diagnose -> fix -> verify -> retry` loop.
  - Integration with `CodeExecutor` for native, sandboxed verification (tsc, vitest, go test).
  - L2 Vault persistence: All healing events and extracted facts are saved as long-term memory for fleet-wide intelligence sharing.

### Changed
- Standardized documentation identity to HyperNexus Kernel & HyperCode.
- Updated `VERSION.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, and `TODO.md` to reflect Phase 5 active sprint goals.
- Unified `docs/UNIVERSAL_LLM_INSTRUCTIONS.md` as the single source of truth for all AI agents.
- Resolved merge conflict markers and aligned role guidelines across `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `GPT.md`, and `copilot-instructions.md`.

## [1.0.0-alpha.60] - 2026-05-16

### Added
- Fully integrated Go-native `MemoryManager` into the core TS control plane.
- Wires up `sqlite-vec` storage backend, replacing the deprecated `@hypernexus/hypernexus` implementation.
- Dual-tier cache invalidation for the L1/L2 memory boundaries.

### Changed
- Shifted authority of MCP configuration sync entirely to the Go sidecar.
- Removed legacy TS synchronization scripts for VSCode and Cursor.
